## Who I am

"JAPJ" is the account name I first got during my study and is based on my name (Jeroen Antonius Petrus Janssen or J.A.P. Janssen).
After graduating I kept using this both at home and work.

## What I do for fun

I read a fair bit (mostly fantasy related) of books and I also try to make music from time to time.
Currently I am singing in two mixed choirs (Tenor), but I still play trombone and bass guitar on occasions.
When I joined my first choir in 2010 I started creating rehearsal tracks to help me learn the choir songs.

## Why I do it

Technology, computers and programming have been a part of my life since my dad used to take home a C64 from his work during the summer holidays. 
By creating choir rehearsal tracks I can combine my 2 passions. 

## What I do at work

I work as a Software Engineer at [Canon Production Printing](https://cpp.canon/careers/) at the R&D site in Venlo.
I have worked in different kinds of projects, both for internal use and on products that are released to customers.
The internal projects mostly focused on build infrastructure and test automation of our print controller software and this is where I spend a fair amount of time on using MSBuild and Python.
