# How do you prepare?

:::note
This (mixing) part of the guide assumes that you already have some form of Part tracks.
I plan on writing another section on how to actually create those (but that is obviously not done yet).
:::

In order to mix a learning track you will need to have the parts (e.g. Soprano, Alt, Tenor and Bass) on isolated tracks.

:::tip
If you have an arrangement where certain voices are split, e.g. SSATB then make sure you also have isolated tracks/staves for S1 and S2.
