# Examples

There are a fair number of people and companies that create (professional) rehearsal tracks.<br/>
Either for their own arrangements or for existing arrangements.

Here are some examples on what Vocal Learning Tracks can sound like.<br/>
(this list is not trying to be complete, but more to show what is possible/available)

### Vocal Synthesis

Not everyone can sing all the high and low parts (or has time to record everything themselves),<br/>
so it is interesting to see usage of vocal synthesis for learning tracks.

  Here an example using ACE Studio (Vocals) and an accompaniment:

## Companies

There are also (bigger) companies with a choral catalog that have produced learning tracks:

- [Hal Leonard Choral](https://www.halleonard.com)
  <YouTubeEmbed id="Wt1n83_Ud_M" />

- [Chorus Online](https://www.chorusonline.nl/home), a Dutch company that sells arrangements and learning tracks.

## Custom Playback on Website

:::note
The following links are examples of online applications that allow you to customize the playback of a learning track<br/>
This gives flexibility on not needing to mix in advance, but it does mean you typically do not have an MP3 to just play.
