# Introduction

Welcome to "Creating Vocal Learning Tracks".

## Where is the guide?

I am writing this guide (starting in March 2025).

You can see [my notes from the Vocal Pop & Jazz Days 2024](https://github.com/japj/VPJD2024), where I talked with several singers and conductors on the practice of learning (choir) songs.

It has been a while since, but I finally started writing and I will use these notes as an input.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or topics that you find interesting.

## What this guide is and isn't

This is not a guide for writing your own vocal arrangements. It is also not about learning to sing.

The goal of this guide is to give you knowledge and practical tips to create your own vocal learning tracks efficiently.

You will be able to create Vocal Learning Tracks for the songs you are singing in your choir, tailored to your needs. 

Every choir is different. Every song is different. Every arrangement is different.

Before deciding to create your own Vocal Learning Tracks, I would suggest looking if someone is already selling them. This saves you time that you can spend on something else and helps another artist out by buying something from their catalog.

If there are no Vocal Learning Track yet then this guide will help you create them.

Here are some of the topics I want to share in this guide:

- Why you need vocal learning tracks
- What variations of vocal learning tracks are possible and make sense
- How to get sheetmusic into a notation program
- How to mix learning tracks efficiently
- How to use a vocal synthesizer for learning tracks

## Who I am

My name is Jeroen Janssen and I have been making music as long as I can remember.

Although I started as an instrumentalist (playing trumpet, trombone and bass guitar), I have been happily singing in mixed choirs (pop/jazz) since 2010. And I have been creating learning tracks right from the start.

You can find a sneak peek at my current workflow at [my blogpost about my step for creating learning tracks](../2025/02/23/my-steps-for-creating-choir-learning-tracks/)

By creating vocal learning tracks I combine two of my passions: computers and music.
